App-ZofCMS-Plugin-UserLogin-ForgotPassword

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS> that adds functionality to
L<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::UserLogin> plugin; that being the "forgot password?"
operations. Namely, this involves showing the user the form to ask for
their login, emailing the user special link which to follow (this is to
establish ligitimate reset) and, finally, to provide a form where a user
can enter their new password (and of course, the plugin will update
the password in the C<users> table). Wow, a mouthful of functionality! :)

This documentation assumes you've read L<App::ZofCMS>, L<App::ZofCMS::Config> 
and L<App::ZofCMS::Template>. Whilst not necessary,
being familiar with L<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::UserLogin> might be helpful.
